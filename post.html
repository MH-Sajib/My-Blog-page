            <h3>2nd blog(Ethical Hacking)</h3>
            <p>Every computer system is vulnerable — hackers prove that daily. So, who can stop them? Believe it or not, hackers.

“Ethical hacking” is a seemingly contradictory term but, when conducted to expose and fix system flaws, ethical hacking is not only legal, it’s vital.

Individuals, companies, government agencies, and universities require sensitive data and proprietary work products to be secured. Consider that the FBI received a record number of U.S. internet crime complaints in 2020 totaling more than $4.1 billion in losses (PDF, 2.6 MB). Enter the ethical hacker, whom cyber security expert Keren Elazari referred to as the internet’s “immune system.”

How can you become an ethical hacker and help strengthen this digital immune system? Read on to learn more about ethical hacking, the skills and education required, the job market, and resources to practice hacking safely and legally. In addition, we’ll dive into the world of ethical hacking competitions where hackers can win big — one 2022 hacking tournament awarded more than $1 million in prize money.

Ready to learn more about ethical hacking? Let’s get started.

What Is an Ethical Hacker?
Hackers identify and exploit gaps and weaknesses in computer systems. Ethical hackers identify the same weaknesses, but do so with the intention of fixing them. The roles of malicious hacker and ethical hacker require similar skills, traits, and techniques, but their motivations are quite different.

Malicious hackers make unauthorized attempts to access computer systems or networks. In response, organizations authorize ethical hackers to identify and close those gaps. Basically, organizations pay ethical hackers to help protect their systems and data from malicious hackers.

According to Purplesec, a cyber security company run by U.S. veterans, cybercrime increased globally by 600 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic and could cost $10.5 trillion by 2025. And, in addition to impacting sensitive data, malicious hackers can even cause harm through medical devices. For example, the late hacker Barnaby Jack demonstrated how to hack pacemakers and insulin pumps so that the loophole giving hackers access could be fixed. In this instance, ethical hacking showed a potential to save lives.

Types of Hackers
Hackers are often classified by their motivations and actions with the analogy of wearing different “hats.” Here are some of the most common types of hackers, identified by the color of their metaphorical hats:

Black Hat: These are cybercriminals. Black hat hackers attack vulnerabilities with malicious intent.
White Hat: Also known as security specialists, white hat hackers look for the same vulnerabilities as black hats but determine how to fix the issues and prevent future attacks. Sometimes, black hats become white hats.
Gray Hat: Gray hats have mixed motivations. They enjoy hacking and often do so without authorization, but they don’t act maliciously. Grey hats often view hacking as sport.
Blue Hat: Tech companies hire blue hat hackers to test products and find security issues. Microsoft hosts an annual BlueHat convention.
Red Hat: Also known as vigilante hackers, red hats act aggressively to stop the black hats and employ some of their strategies. Government agencies hire red hats for their mission focus.
Green Hat: These are the hacking beginners who want to become white, blue, or red hats (but hopefully not black hats). How do they learn? Let’s take a look.</p>
